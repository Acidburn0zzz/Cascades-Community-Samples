# Charts For BB10

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to integrate various type of charts with a WebView QML component and a third-part library for the chart [chartJS](www.chartjs.org)

Type of charts used:

	-bar
	-line
	-radar
	-polar area
	-pie & doughnut
	-bubble

The datasets, labels and options are generated by a js function in the QML file. This function converts the objects generated into a JSON string and then sends it to HTML page via *webview.postMessage* function of the WebView.
The string encoded is captured from the function inside HTML page that generates the chart using the chartjs library.
The HTML function can answer to the WevView with *navigator.cascades.postMessage*. It is useful if you need the png of the chart. In this case a method of chartjs returns a base64 encoding of the image and, with a c++ implementation called FromBase64ToPNGImage, the image is converted and saved in a specific path.
