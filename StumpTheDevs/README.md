#Stump the BlackBerry Devs#

This directory collects challenges and solutions in the
[Stump The BlackBerry Devs!](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2012/08/stump-blackberry-devs/) Program.
Challenge submissions are tweets sent to [@BlackBerryDev](http://twitter.com/BlackBerryDev)
tagged as _#StumpTheBlackBerryDevs_.  You can use a search engine like Topsy to
[search for them](http://topsy.com/s?q=%23StumpTheBlackBerryDevs).

Challenges and their solutions are grouped together.  Usually the community submits challenges and the solutions come from RIM's team, but any combinations will be accepted; we will fine-tune the arrangement as we go.

We encourage you to submit your solutions as pull requests against this repository.  To clearly allow anybody
to leverage all the submissions in their own applications, please use our
[Standard Contribution Process](http://blackberry.github.com/howToContribute.html) and add your name
