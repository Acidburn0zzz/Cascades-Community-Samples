ScreenCapture is a sample Cascades application that demonstrates how to use the native Camera API for recording the device screen or the second screen ie. HDMI display (mirror mode or custom displays generated by apps that support separate output to the HDMI display or Miracast).  A user simply has to adjust the settings accordingly and then press the start or stop buttons to encode or record video.  Encoding captures but does not save it to a file (This method could be utilized by a developer in their own derived apps to intercept the frames and do something custom with them for preview.  The callback mode used in this sample cannot be used to modify the frames before saving but you can copy the frames to a screen buffer for rendering in a native window).  If you start recording, it will create a new video file to store the captured video.

Suggested settings for best results:

Screen capture:
15 fps max, NV12 format for full screen resolution on any BlackBerry 10 device.

If you update or modify this example, please update the running version info as well.
